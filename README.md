## Growth Mindset

Having a **growth mindset** is important because it allows you to *positively* expand your learning. It's about believing in yourself and realising that **hard work and effort** will get you to where you need to be and that talent/intelligence is simply a starting point. Anyone can learn with a growth mindset.  

### A Fixed Mindset Can Be Damaging To Your Learning

**Fixed Mindset:** 

> ~~I will avoid this challenge because it seems too hard.~~

**Growth Mindset:**

> I will embrace this challenge because everyone starts somewhere. 

## How Am I Going To Keep a Growth Mindset? 
1. Embrace challenges 
2. Let other coders inspire me/motivate me
3. work hard and persist

## The Terminal

- The Terminal is a different way of navigating your files and folders on your computer.
-  It allows you to access, create and edit folders by typing out commands. 
-  This is a quick and convenient way of nagivating as you don't have to reach for the mouse (however it can also slow things down if it doesn't work)

## Text Editors 

- Text editors are a quick and convenient way of coding. 
- They create shortcuts and the end of tags to speed up your coding process. 
- They are also a great way of sharing your code with friends and colleagues and working on collaborative projects. 
- You can use text editors to practice code and track your progress
