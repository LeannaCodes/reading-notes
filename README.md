## Growth Mindset

Having a **growth mindset** is important because it allows you to *positively* expand your learning. It's about believing in yourself and realising that **hard work and effort** will get you to where you need to be and that talent/intelligence is simply a starting point. Anyone can learn with a growth mindset.  

### A Fixed Mindset Can Be Damaging To Your Learning

**Fixed Mindset:** 

> ~~I will avoid this challenge because it seems too hard.~~

**Growth Mindset:**

> I will embrace this challenge because everyone starts somewhere. 

## How Am I Going To Keep a Growth Mindset? 
1. Embrace challenges 
2. Let other coders inspire me/motivate me
3. work hard and persist
