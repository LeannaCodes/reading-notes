<h1>JavaScript</h1>

<p>First start by creating a script.js file. We use 'let' as a declaration. For example:
            Let name = value
    If something is in quotes, it's called a string. 
    In Javaspcript you have a console where you can log information you want to see.  
    // in javascript is a comment

    To execute a function, you write and put a set of bracketts afterwards. For example:
    prompt ("This message will pop up when loaded")

    <h2>if statements</h2>
    if (this is true) {then this function will work}
    else = alternatively, try this. 


</p>
