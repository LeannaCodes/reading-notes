<h1 class="h1-underline">JavaScript</h1>

<p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that adds interactive elements to your website.
    Think of building a website like a human body. HTML is the bones, CSS is the clothes, accessories
    and makeup, and JavaScript is the brain making that makes you function.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Jargon</h2>

<h3>The Script Tag</h3>

<p>The Script tag is where you will be adding your code in your HTML document. You should add the script 
    tag to the relevant section in your HTML document.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        First start by creating a script.js file. 
        We use 'let' as a declaration. For example: Let name = value
        If something is in quotes, it's called a string.
        In Javaspcript you have a console where you can log information you want to see.
        // in javascript is a comment
        To execute a function, you write and put a set of bracketts afterwards. For example: function ("This is the message")</p>

    <h2>if statements</h2>

    <p>if (this is true) {then this function will work} - in simpler terms, (if they've selected or submitted this answer)
         {then it will trigger this}.
         
         JavaScript will run commands/rules in the order that they appear/you've written them in. This means it's important 
         to note which rules need to go first or they won't achieve the desired result. Because of this, we need tell Java 
         what to do if the statement isn't true. 

         else if = if the statement isn't true, try this. For example:
        </p>

    
    </li>
</ul>
