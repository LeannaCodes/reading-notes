React Components: 

react has two types of components. 

- Functional (Stateless)
- Class (stateful)

What is Props? 

React is a component-based library that divides the UI into reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between compnents is by using props. 

"props" is a special keyword in REACT, which stands for PROPERTIES and is being used for PASSING DATA FROM ONE COMPONENT TO ANOTHER. 

properties are being passed in a uni-directional flow which means from parent to child.
