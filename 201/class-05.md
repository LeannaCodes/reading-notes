## Images

### Adding Images 

The `<img>` tag is used to add an image into the page. This is an empty element (which means there is **no closing tag**). It must carry the following two attributes: 
- src 
    This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image file. 
- alt
    This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it. 
- title
    you can also use the title to provide additional information about the image. Mostly this is used for when people hover over an image.

`<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image of an image" title="This is an image that is called an image" />`

### Where to place images in your document

Where you place the image in the code is important because browsers show HTML elements in one of two ways. 

## Color

## Text

## Image Formats 

### JPEG

Whenever you have many different colours in a picture you should use a JPEG. A photograph that features snow or an overcast sky might look like it has large areas that are just white or grey, but the picture is usually made up of many different colours that are subtly different. 

### PNG/GIF 

When a picture has an area that is filled with exactly the same colour, it is known as **flat colour**.  Logos, illustrations, and diagrams often use flat colours. **(Note that photographs of snow, sky or grass are not flat colours, they are made up of many subtle different shades of the same colour and are not suited to GIF or PNG format)**

**Animated GIFS** show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple instructions. 

**Transparent GIFs** - if the transparent part of the image has straight edges and it is 100% transparent (that is, not semi-opaque), you can save the image as a GIF (with the transparency option selected)

**Transparent PNG** - If the transparent part of the image has a diagonal or rounded edges or if you want a semi-opaque transparency or a drop-shadow, then you will need to save it as a PNG. Transparent PNGs are not fully supported in older browsers, there is some JavaScript you can use to get around this issue .
