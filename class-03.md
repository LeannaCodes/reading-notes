# Git, VS Code and Repositories 

## Git Summary

- Git is a tool to help manage your repos and organise your work. 
- Git helps you track your work by taking 'snapshots' of your repository.
- Git keeps history of these 'snapshots'. 
- Git has a special label called ***HEAD*** which means ***you are here***
- Ususally you give a 'snapshot'(changes) a label called a message. This is so when you're working on a collab project, your team will be able to see and understand any modifications to the repos that has been changed.

## Git Code 
- **git status** = Shows Changes 
- **git clone** = Clones repos to your location in the terminal (Make sure you're in the correct directory)
- **git add** = Adds to be committed (Note that space . will add all files to be committed)
- **git commit** = Commits files to be pushed. 
- **git push** = Pushes the files to your Github

### TIP! If your changes are green, it has succesfully been added. 

**GIT IS NOT THE SAME AS GITHUB.**
